# Basic YouTube Downloader Configuration
# 
# This is a simple example showing the minimum required configuration
# to download YouTube videos.

# Target folder where videos will be saved
# 
# IMPORTANT FOR DOCKER USERS:
# When using Docker, this should typically be "/downloads" which maps to
# the volume you configured in docker-compose.yml
#
# Path formats for Python (non-Docker) usage:
# - Relative path: "./downloads" or "downloads"
# - Windows absolute: "C:\\Users\\YourName\\Videos"
# - Windows UNC (network): "\\\\ServerName\\ShareName\\folder" or "//ServerName/ShareName/folder"
# - Linux/Mac absolute: "/home/user/videos"
#
# For Docker with mapped drives, see NETWORK_DRIVES.md
#
target_folder: "/downloads"
